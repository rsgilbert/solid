# INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE 

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

This means that an interface should not be bloated
with methods that implementing classes don't require.

The interface advocates breaking down a fat interface into smaller interfaces called role interfaces that work 
well together.

In this way, the implementation classes implement only those interfaces they are interested in.
